# PopularMovies
Udacity Android Fast Track Project phase 2

# API Key setting
For the API Key of the Movie DB API, you can go to util/NetworkUtil.java and put the api key in the static variable name MOVIE_DB_API_KEY

# My note
I implement in a way that quite different from the lessons. I know that this might be too much for this application, but I would like to try the MVP pattern stuffs that I have read before and along with the lessons. So in this repository, I also include other libraries (e.g. Dagger, Retrofit, GSON, OkHttp, RxJava, RxAndroid, ButterKnife, Storio).
